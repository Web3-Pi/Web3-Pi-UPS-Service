# Web3 Pi UPS Service Configuration
# Copy this file to /etc/w3p-ups/config.toml and adjust as needed

[serial]
# Serial port where the RP2040 Pico is connected
port = "/dev/ttyACM0"
# Baud rate for serial communication
baud_rate = 115200

[battery]
# Battery SOC (State of Charge) percentage below which shutdown is triggered
# Shutdown only occurs when BOTH conditions are met:
# 1. SOC is below this threshold
# 2. Input voltage indicates we're running on battery (vi < min_valid_voltage)
shutdown_threshold = 10

# Minimum input voltage (in mV) to consider grid power as connected
# Values 8000-21000 typically indicate grid power is present
# Below this value, the system is considered to be running on battery
min_valid_voltage = 8000

[shutdown]
# Path to the shutdown script that will be executed
# This script should handle graceful shutdown of your services
script_path = "/etc/w3p-ups/shutdown.sh"

# Delay in seconds before executing shutdown after low battery is detected
# This gives time for power to potentially be restored
# If power is restored during this period, shutdown is cancelled
delay_seconds = 30

[logging]
# Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = "info"

# Optional path for file logging (in addition to journald)
# Leave empty or comment out to log only to journald
# file_path = "/var/log/w3p-ups.log"
